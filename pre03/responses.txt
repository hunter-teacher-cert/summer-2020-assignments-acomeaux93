//1. What is the output of the following program? Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are newlines.

The output is this:

"No, I wug."
"You wugga wug."
"I wug."

The new lines are intentional because each println statement prints on a new line



//2. Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked.

(main) --> (zoop) --> (baffle) --> (ping)



//3. What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method? (We will see why in the next chapter.)

Infinite loop because of a circular reference, each method calling on the other without a stopping point
